# java-fundamentals
This repository will hold my work for the first project at the Advanced level course of Java at ASAC. 


## Lab-01

***
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- functions inside the class and calling them in the main.
- Random to get random values.
- LocalDateTime to get LocalDateTime now
- DateTimeFormatter to find the time with certain pattern (I used HH:mm:ss)
- format to format that time and save it inside a string variable. 

## Lab-02 
***
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- Random to get random values within a specific range.
- Nested loops to check is an array has duplicated values and find the average of arrays in a 2D array.
- adding test cases inside the test file to test for the problems using @Test , assetEquals ,assertTrue,assertFalse and assertArrayEquals.
