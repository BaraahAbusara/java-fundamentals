# java-fundamentals
This repository will hold my work for the first project at the Advanced level course of Java at ASAC. 

## Lab-01
***
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- functions inside the class and calling them in the main.
- Random to get random values.
- LocalDateTime to get LocalDateTime now
- DateTimeFormatter to find the time with certain pattern (I used HH:mm:ss)
- format to format that time and save it inside a string variable. 

## Lab-02 
***
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- Random to get random values within a specific range.
- Nested loops to check is an array has duplicated values and find the average of arrays in a 2D array.
- adding test cases inside the test file to test for the problems using @Test , assetEquals ,assertTrue,assertFalse and assertArrayEquals.

## Lab-03
***
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- I/O from a file inside the resources directory using Scanner and its methods(nextLine,hasNextLine).
- used Map and its methods (containsKey,put,get).
- used ArrayList and its methods (get).
- used FileNotFoundException.
- used endsWith to look is a string ends with a specific value.
- used ClassLoader to find paths for testing. 


## Lab-06 : inheritance 
***
In this lab I implemented: 
- Restaurant class that has a name , stars ,priceCategory and arrayList of reviews.
- Reviews class that provided the used to  make a review with a body, author and stars to the Restaurant.
- AddReviews that adds the review to the arrayList in the restaurant. 

## Lab-07 : inheritance-2 
In this lab I implemented class Company that is the parent of classes Restaurant, Shop and Theater.
Each of them is an inheritance to Company taking its arguments and methods overriding some of them and implementing new methods and arguments. 
I implemented movie object to be added inside the moviesList inside the theater and users can add their reviews to the "Company" reviewsList , and can add it to a specific movie in the theater.
