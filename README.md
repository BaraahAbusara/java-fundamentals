# java-fundamentals
This repository will hold my work for the first project at the Advanced level course of Java at ASAC. 

## Lab-01 
***
This lab included tasks being solved using following methods:
- functions inside the class and calling them in the main.
- Random to get random values.
- LocalDateTime to get LocalDateTime now 
- DateTimeFormatter to find the time with certain pattern (I used HH:mm:ss) 
- format to format that time and save it inside a string variable.
